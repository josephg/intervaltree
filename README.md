# Interval tree

> **EXPERIMENTAL!** This library is currently being written & experimented with. It is in no way finished. It is not ready to be used by anyone.

This is a simple implementation of a 1 dimensional [Interval Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_tree), but which uses local relative interval offsets instead of absolute ones. This allows the interval tree to be stretched or collapsed around a point.
